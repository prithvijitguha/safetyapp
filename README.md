# Final Project: CS50â€™s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript:

# safeindex:

## About: 
Have you ever visited a restaurant, theater or park and felt that this place seemed nice but needs to be a bit more hospitable, manage their crowd better or address some hygiene issues. That's what 'safeindex' is for; it is a website that lets you view the safety and hygiene reviews of any place so you can make an informed decision about visiting it. Anyone can view reviews but only an authorised user can rate any establishment based on how safe and hygienic it is (out of 5 stars). It even allows users to give their recommendations whether it is suitable for a group of people only or if it is suitable for a solo visit as well? Need more space to speak your mind? You can leave text reviews as well along with your star rating. Stay safe, clean and informed the next time you step out!


## Features:
1. Introduction: Only for new users, to orient with site and objectives 
2. Use google maps to see your current location and search from there
3. View safety and hygiene reviews for places from other users
4. Register, login and logout. Google login enabled 
5. Authenticated users can submit reviews 
6. Edit your previous reviews
7. Single Page Application, implemented using Javascript
